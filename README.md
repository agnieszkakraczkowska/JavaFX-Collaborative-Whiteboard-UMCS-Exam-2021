# JavaFX-Collaborative-Whiteboard-UMCS-Exam-2021

This Java project is a collaborative whiteboard application that allows multiple users to draw and interact on a shared canvas in real-time. Key features include:

- Real-Time Collaboration: Users can connect to a shared canvas over a network and draw in real-time.

- Hexadecimal Color Validation: The program validates color input from clients to ensure it adheres to hexadecimal color code format, providing error prevention and correction.

- Coordinate Offset: The canvas can be moved using arrow keys, updating the coordinate system for all users.

- Coordinate Display: Current offset coordinates are displayed in the application's user interface, enhancing user awareness of the canvas position.
